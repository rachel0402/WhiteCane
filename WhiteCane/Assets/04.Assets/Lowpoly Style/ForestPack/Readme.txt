Thank you very much for your purchase. I hope you enjoy the asset!

To get the same look as in the screenshots on the asset store page, please use the included Forest-PostProcessingProfile included in this pack and put it into Unitys new Post Processing Stack (Available for Free from the Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912)

For newer Unity versions, please get the post processing stack V2 from the package manager and use the V2 profile.

The reason for this is the following: due to version incompatibilities, I am not allowed to include image effects in my upload.

If you need help, just contact me via publisher mail (chunityassets@gmail.com)
